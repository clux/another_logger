//! An example using the Builder pattern API to configure the logger at compile-time.
//!
//! The default output is `module::path: message`, and the "tag", which is the text to the left of
//! the colon, is colorized. This example shows how to change the output to: `level: message` with
//! no colorization. It also demonstrates explicitly setting the log level with the `max_level`
//! instead of implicitly with a verbosity.
//!
//! The [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) argument parser is used in this example, but loggerv
//! works with any argument parser.
